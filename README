Run:
python process.py > plays.py
and plays.py will then be a valid python script which is
basically the output of python's pprint function on the data.

It defines 3 variables:

 * plays - the main data
 * castLinks - Any links to cast members sites found
 * theatres - links to the theatres and their logos.
